# Evolutive Encryption with Genetic Algorithm
This project presents a Python implementation of a genetic algorithm designed to optimize the encryption key for a message encrypted with the Vigenère cipher.

## Description
The cipher developed by Blaise de Vigenère during the 16th century was considered unbreakable for many years, earning it the nickname *the unbreakable cipher*. Despite its current vulnerability, this cipher had a significant impact on cryptography.

## Getting Started

### Libraries used
- numpy
- random
- string
- copy
- matplotlib.pyplot

### Project files
Inside the "Evolutive-encryption" folder, you'll find two main files:
- `ga_vigenere.py`: Main script to run and modify parameters.  
- `GA_vigenere.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with detailed explanations and step-by-step walkthrough.

### Running the program
To run the program, execute the main script with:  
```
python3 ga_vigenere.py
```
You can also modify parameters directly inside `ga_vigenere.py` before running.
